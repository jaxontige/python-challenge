# python-challenge
Corbin and I worked collaboratively on this, we also got some great help from classmate Jesse and some others through Slack
The cereal activity from class was very helpful for PyBank, reviewing dictionary activities was helpful with PyPoll, as well as class slides regarding dictionaries, lists, loops, etc..
Google was a huge help troubleshooting functions and syntax, but also to find similar solutions online for reference
